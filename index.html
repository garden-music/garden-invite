    <p><b>Howdy,</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Ok, what is this?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    Garden is basically a co-op we’ve built to help collectively grow streaming and listership with a real targeted audience for everyone that is a part of it. With over a decade of advertising and design experience, we basically wanted to use our skillset to level up everyone's listernship together. The more people the join, the more powerful it works.</p>
    <p><b>Who is this for?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    You probably, if you have this link lol.<span class="big-break"></span>
    But this is mainly folks that have great quality music, without much knowledge or energy for direct response marketing. If you would like to grow your music/band’s streams/monthly listeners/general listenership/ and would like to associate your bands more closely with other similar genre artists we curate on the co-op, this is a great way of doing so.</p>
    <p><b>How does it work?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    Ads pretty much.<span class="big-break"></span>
    We have built up a robust playlist audience / network using direct response marketing. Specifically meta ads which direct people to follow and stream different playlists across Spotify / Apple Music / Tidal / Youtube Music.</p>
    <p><b>What makes this special?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    We are doing this as a co-op, so instead of creating campaigns for each individual artist, we are effectively pooling our adspend together and creating a multiplier effect (up to 5x your daily cost to be part of it). The more people that join, the more powerful the daily spend and reach becomes, and therefore the more powerful the streaming numbers. You leave the advertising work up to us, so that you can focus on the music.</p>
    <p><b>Do I need to give a shit about streaming?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    Absolutely not!<span class="big-break"></span>
    But if you are interested, whether for it be for vanity metrics to show a label/booker, or just the sheer concept that more people are listening to the beautiful art you have labored over, this is a great way of getting more ears on your project quickly and consistently.</p>
    <p><b>How much does it cost?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    $5/day, billed monthly, for as long as you’d like to be a part of it. We just ask that you start with at least 60 days before jumping off.</p>
    <p>We recommend a long-term strategy of daily spend to have a constant passive stream of your genre’s fans discovering your music. This can nurture the platform algorithms, where you can provide enough new data points to trigger organic growth. This of course depends on whether listeners resonate with your music.</p>
    <p><b>Are results guaranteed?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    We aren’t selling streams. But we are growing playlists with active listeners, so your streams and monthly listeners will grow. We rotate the playlist order automatically to ensure everyone is getting time at the very  top of the playlist, where more of the streaming historically comes.<span class="big-break"></span>
    We aren’t going to say you’re going to get X about of streams for X amount of dollars, but we can show some general stats from these below:</p>
    <p><b>Why are we doing this?</b><span class="big-break"></span>
    We started this because we learned to do paid advertising for our own bands, we reinvest money from shows into promotion to grow the reach of our projects. We realized we could work together to expand our reach, and then realized that we could work with more artists to expand everyone's reach. We love music, and we want good music to be heard.</p>
